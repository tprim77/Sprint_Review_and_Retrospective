# Sprint_Review_and_Retrospective

* How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? 

To interpret user needs and implement them into a program, I confirm what I suspect the user wants with the product owner and other team members. Creating user stories helps with this because they clearly show what the user wants. There may be a few questions in the user story but the product owner generally should be able to answer any of those questions or find out.
* How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I developing programs in a mostly agile way. I break down the parts that need implemented and then implement them one at a time, making sure each section works before moving onto the next. I hope to be able to incorporate full sprints into my projects in the future as they will get more complex. I currently do not use "full" sprints because most of the work needs to be done quicker than a few weeks which is traditionally a sprint period.
* What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think a good team member is one that provides all of their expertise to the team and tries to help where they can. A good team member also tries their best even if they are unsure of the work being done. They ask questions when confused and get confirmation and clarity on any questions they have. They try to be a team player in everything they do.
